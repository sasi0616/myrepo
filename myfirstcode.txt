This is my first code!!
Creating the local repo:
Create file -> Git bash here -> git add -> git commit -m "commmit name goes here" -> git status

Now moving the local repo code to central repo;

Copy the below command from github and paste in git bash

git remote add origin "xxxxxx" - local repo integrated with central repo

Now push the code to central repo

git push origin master
